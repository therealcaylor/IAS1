1 - Write a script that reads n frequency values (in Hertz) from a list of numbers.
Creates n sinusoids, each with one frequency from the list and Plays all the sinusoids simultaneously

2- # Reads n “notes” from a list of tuples (each tuple is made by two numbers: frequency in Hertz, duration in seconds).Plays the melody of the n notes using sinusoids (each note starts immediately after the previous one).Hint: check the documentation of the out() method in the Sine class, particularly its optional arguments
