1- Write/test a function firstGreater(data, val) that returns the index of the first element of data that is strictly greater than val. If no such element is found, return −1.
If the val argument is not passed, it defaults to 0.


2- Write/test a function threshold(vals, goal) where vals is a sequence of numbers and goal is a positive number.
The function returns the smallest integer n such that the sum of the first n numbers in vals is >= goal. If the goal is unachievable, the function returns 0.

3- Write/test a function isSubstring(p, s) that checks whether the string p (pattern) is a substring of the string s, and returns a boolean result. Do not rely on built-in behaviors of the string class, other than string length calculation with len() and string indexing to retrieve.

4- Write/test a recursive function countdown(n) that prints numbers as it counts down from n to zero, and prints “stop” at the end.
